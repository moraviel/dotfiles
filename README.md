# dotfiles

Personal Arch Linux dotfiles with a two-layer architecture: a `base/` layer
shared by every machine, and a `<hostname>/` layer applied only on the
matching machine. The host layer is picked up automatically from
`/etc/hostname`.

## Machines

| Hostname       | Role                | GPU    | Monitors                          |
|----------------|---------------------|--------|------------------------------------|
| `UXL-4JSYDX3`  | Work laptop         | NVIDIA | 1 built-in + 2-3 external (shared desk, varies by office) |
| `D7JW8FS`      | Personal desktop    | none (integrated) | 2 fixed |

Both machines should be installed with full-disk encryption (LUKS2), same as
the Ubuntu installs they're replacing — see
[docs/disk-encryption.md](docs/disk-encryption.md) for the install-time
procedure. This has to be done before this repo is even cloned; `make` only
configures a system that's already installed.

## Usage

```sh
git clone <this-repo> ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
make            # deps -> pkgs -> aur -> cfg -> hooks
```

Or run steps individually:

```sh
make deps    # git submodules + install paru if missing
make pkgs    # pacman -S base/packages + <hostname>/packages (deduped)
make aur     # paru -S base/aur-packages + <hostname>/aur-packages (deduped)
make cfg     # deploy config/ -> / for base, then for the current hostname
make hooks   # run base/hooks/<pkg>.sh + <hostname>/hooks/<pkg>.sh per package
```

`$HOST` is read from `/etc/hostname` automatically; override it (e.g. for a
dry run against a different host layer) with `make cfg HOST=OTHER-HOST`.

### Config deployment rules (`make cfg`)

- `config/etc/X` → `/etc/X` (written with `sudo`)
- `config/usr/X` → `/usr/X` (written with `sudo`)
- `config/home/{{USER}}/X` → `$HOME/X` (written as the current user, no sudo)
- `{{USER}}` is replaced with `$USER` in every deployed file's *contents* —
  this matters because the two machines have different usernames.
- If a directory contains a `.clean` marker file, everything already in the
  corresponding target directory is deleted before the new files are copied
  in.
- `.gitkeep` and `.clean` are never copied to their targets.
- `base/config` is deployed first, then `<hostname>/config` — a file present
  in both layers is simply overwritten by the host-specific version (there is
  no merging).

### Hooks (`make hooks`)

For every package name in `base/packages`, `base/aur-packages`,
`<hostname>/packages` and `<hostname>/aur-packages`, the corresponding
`base/hooks/<pkg>.sh` and `<hostname>/hooks/<pkg>.sh` are executed if they
exist (base first). Use these for anything a plain package install doesn't
cover: enabling a systemd service, editing `mkinitcpio.conf`, adding the user
to a group, etc.

## Notes

- Monitor layout for `UXL-4JSYDX3` is intentionally left mostly unconfigured
  in `niri`'s `config.kdl` since the external monitor setup changes by desk;
  run `niri msg outputs` after docking and adjust the commented-out `output`
  blocks. `D7JW8FS` ships a real 2-monitor `output` layout as a starting
  point — update the connector names to match `niri msg outputs` on that
  machine.
- Steam/Lutris require the `[multilib]` repo; `make pkgs` enables it
  automatically in `/etc/pacman.conf` when a host's package list requests
  `steam` or `lutris` and it isn't enabled yet.
- Plymouth boot splash and NVIDIA modeset both need a kernel command-line
  change (`splash` / `nvidia_drm.modeset=1`) that's bootloader-specific
  (GRUB vs systemd-boot) — the relevant hooks print what to add instead of
  editing your bootloader config for you.
- Git configuration (`.gitconfig`), GPG/SSH keys, and commit-signing setup
  are **not** managed here — set those up by hand on each machine.
- AUR package names (VS Code, Bitwarden, etc.) can be renamed or dropped by
  their maintainers over time; if `make aur` fails on one, check
  `https://aur.archlinux.org` for the current name and update `aur-packages`.
- Several tools are deliberately installed via their own official installer
  scripts in `base/hooks/always.sh` instead of AUR packages, to keep the AUR
  footprint small — each is idempotent (skipped if already on `$PATH`):
  - **JetBrains Toolbox** — tarball downloaded directly from JetBrains
    (resolved via their releases API) into
    `~/.local/share/JetBrains/toolbox-app`, symlinked onto `$PATH` at
    `~/.local/bin/jetbrains-toolbox`, with a `.desktop` entry dropped in.
    Launch it once after `make hooks` — first run does its own IDE-manager
    setup and autostart registration.
